x' = v0 * cos(theta)
y' = v0 * sin(theta)
theta = angle

x' = R/2(vr + vl)cos(angle) // vr and vl are velocities of right and left wheel
y' = R/2(vr + vl)sin(angle)
angle = R/L(vr - vl) // R is radius of wheel and L is width

w = angle

vr = (2v + wL)/2R
vl = (2v - wL)/2R

how to find angle = arctan((ygoal - y)/(xgoal - x)
Remember to make K big for w = K(angle to goal - angle)

angle = angle(obstacle) + (pi)
// Pure avoidance

angle = angle(obstacle) +- (pi/2)
// Perpendicular to obstacle
